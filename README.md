this is still in wip hell

TODO:
change tap fadeouts to decrease in brightness uniformly, rather than what we got now
universialize a speed modifier so every node has a controllable speed factor (decides how fast the animations play + the duration of the note)

maaaybe combine each note color? idk if thats possible but its a lot of reused code so maybe
